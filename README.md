# MNIST_digit_recognition

MNIST digit recognition with few neural networks

# Three different neural networks

  - SMALL with one hidden layer and only 8 units
  - BASIC with one dden layer and 128 units
  - BIG with two hidden layer and 256/512 units 

# Comparing all three networks

# Building "best" neural network 
  - using checkpoints and early-stopping
