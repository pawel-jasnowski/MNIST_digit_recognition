## General info

MNIST Digit Recognition is like 'Hello world' in Machine Learning. I use MNIST dataset -  60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images 28x28 pixel. I build three different models for this problem. Models are more or less complex. This way I can see which one works better and which one is doing as good as I want it.
