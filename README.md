# MNIST_digit_recognition

MNIST digit recognition with few neural networks.

# Three different neural networks:
  SMALL with one hidden layer and only 8 unints
  BASIC with one dden layer and 128 units
  BIG with two hidden layer and 256/512 units 

# Comparing all three networks for its accuracy

# Building "best" neural network out from the basic and big network, using checkpoints and early-stopping
